{"name":"Confirmation Code Generator","body":"Confirmation Code Generator\r\n===========================\r\nInspired by a similar class written by David Boskovic (http://github.com/dboskovic)\r\n\r\nInformation\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis generator encrypts and decrypts ID numbers to and from an Alpha Numeric (A-Z,0-9)\r\nTracking number like code. It then stores a Salt, and a Salt Format ID within the code.\r\nWhen the Code is decrypted it looks for the Salt Format ID which tells the class where\r\nit can find the Salt within the Code. The Salt is then extracted from the Code and sent\r\nto the decrypter where it is used to determine which decryption key should be used.\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n=====\r\n\r\n\t<?php\r\n\t$ConfCode = new ConfirmationCode;\r\n\t\r\n\t// $len is the length of the id (The code itself will tack on 4 characters.)\r\n\t// If $len = 8 then the code will be 12 digits long. If $len = 4 then the code\r\n\t// will be 8 digits long.\r\n\t$code = $ConfCode->auto('id' [, $len = 8]);\r\n\t\r\n\t// $code is the generated code.\r\n\t$id = $ConfCode->auto($code);\r\n\t\r\n\t// $id is the decrypted number.\r\n\t\r\n\t?>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nConfirmation Code Generator by Kelly Lauren Summer Becker is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\r\nPermissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at http://kellybecker.me.\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png\" alt=\"BY-SA\" title=\"BY-SA\">](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)","tagline":"Encrypts and decrypts ID numbers to and from an Alpha Numeric code","google":"UA-19766005-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
